# Mimick

**Linux's answer to Edge Read Aloud.** Opens a PDF, reads it out in a natural
voice, and highlights each word as it says it. There is a Windows installer
too, but see the warning below before you trust it.

> ### Heads up: this is brand new, and AI-written
>
> Mimick was written with AI, by Claude Code with me steering, and **may have
> major flaws and bugs.** Keep backups of anything precious.
>
> **Windows is untested.** The Windows installer was written and reasoned
> through on Linux and has never been run on an actual Windows machine. It may
> simply not work. Linux is the version that is used daily.

> [Bug reports](#found-a-bug) very welcome.

## What it does

- **Reads aloud** in natural voices — 47 English online, 38 offline.
- **Highlights each word** as it speaks, and scrolls to follow.
- **Speeds up** to 5×, or down to 0.75×.
- **Skips the junk** — headers, footers, sidebars, citations, reference lists.
- **Highlight and annotate** in four colours, with margin notes. Saved as real
  PDF annotations, so Okular, Acrobat and Zotero see them too.
- **Converts to MP3** for listening away from the computer.
- **Works offline** with Piper voices.
- **Keeps your place** in every document.

## Installing

You need Python 3.10 or newer. Either installer is safe to run again if
something breaks — that repairs a broken setup.

**Linux.** Open this folder in a terminal — in Files, right-click it and choose
**Open in Terminal** — then:

```
./install.sh
```

Enter your password if asked. Mimick lands in your applications menu.

**Windows — untested, see above.** Nobody has yet run this on Windows. If you
are willing to be the first, right-click this folder, choose **Open in
Terminal**, then:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

(The `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is because Windows blocks downloaded scripts by
default. It applies to this one command only.) Mimick lands in your Start Menu.

Either way it takes a few minutes, and everything stays inside this folder and
your own user folder. Your system Python is untouched.

## Using it

Open a PDF (`Ctrl`+`O`, or right-click → *Open With*), then press **Space**.

Click any sentence to read from there, or drag across a passage and press
**Enter** to read just that. **Right-click anywhere** for *Start reading from
here* — handy when clicking to read is switched off. Speed is top left, voice
top right.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Start reading, or pause |
| `Enter` | Read the selection, then stop |
| `←` `→` | Back or forward a sentence |
| `Ctrl`+`C` | Copy the selected text |
| `Ctrl`+`H` / `Ctrl`+`M` | Highlight / highlight with a note |
| `Ctrl`+`J` / `Ctrl`+`K` | Next / previous note |
| `Ctrl`+`R` | Show what will be read |
| `Ctrl`+`O` / `Ctrl`+`S` / `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`S` | Open / Save / Save As |

**Help → Keyboard shortcuts** has the rest.

## Highlighting and notes

Select text and press `Ctrl`+`H` to highlight, or `Ctrl`+`M` to highlight and
write a note. Notes sit in a panel beside the page, lined up with the passage
they belong to. Double-click one to edit or delete it.

A note is stored *inside* its highlight, which is how PDFs work — so every note
belongs to a highlight, and other readers show it as that highlight's comment.
Set your name under **Notes → Note appearance** and it's saved as the author.

**Your notes save themselves.** Mimick never writes to the PDF you opened: a
second or so after each change, your highlights and notes go to a copy beside
it named `Whatever (notes).pdf`. Open the original again and Mimick opens that
copy, so your notes are waiting. `Ctrl`+`S` saves straight away rather than
waiting; **Save As** puts a copy wherever you like.

## What gets read, and what doesn't

Academic PDFs are full of things you don't want spoken. Sorted by position, a
running header and a footer DOI land in the middle of a sentence:

> *"Introduction — Journal of Applied Nonsense, Vol 12 — the results were
> broadly consistent with doi.org/10.0000/example.2024"*

So Mimick works out each page's layout instead, and leaves out the furniture.
Also left out: **in-text citations** (`[14]`, `(Okafor et al., 2019)`,
`(p. 88)`), **reference lists**, the **masthead** and the author declarations at
the end. Web addresses and page numbers are never read, and words hyphenated
across a line break are rejoined, so "under- stood" is spoken as one word.

Press `Ctrl`+`R` to see the decisions: numbered regions get read, dimmed ones
don't, and **clicking any region changes it** — remembered for that document.

Two switches in **Display** turn the skipping off if you want everything:
*Skip citations while reading* and *Clean up text for reading*.

## Converting to MP3

**File → Convert to MP3.** Choose the file name, folder, voice, speed, and how
much — the whole document, a page range, or your selection. It tells you how
long the conversion will take and how long the audio will run before it starts.
Cancel stops immediately and leaves no half-written file.

The cleanup switch is here too, starting from whatever Display is set to, so you
can keep the reference list out of your listening and still make a complete
recording when you want one.

## Reading offline

The default voices are Microsoft's online ones, the same as Edge's Read Aloud.
For offline, **Voice → Manage offline voices** lists 176 Piper voices — about
60 MB each. `en_GB-alan-medium` is a good first choice.

**If your connection drops mid-document**, Mimick switches to an installed
offline voice and carries on, provided you downloaded one beforehand.

Piper doesn't report exactly when it says each word, so offline highlighting is
estimated rather than exact. **Kokoro** is also available — better quality, but
a 350 MB download and much slower.

## If something goes wrong

**"No readable text"** — it's a scan. Run `ocrmypdf scanned.pdf readable.pdf`
first.

**"Voices could not be loaded"** — the online voices need internet.

**The notes panel looks empty** — check the two chips at the top of it.

**No sound** — check Settings → Sound; Mimick uses your default output.

**Windows says it can't run the script** — use the full command above, with
`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.

**Windows can't find Python** — install it from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), not the Microsoft Store. The
Store copy can't build the environment Mimick needs.

**Anything else** — run the installer again. It repairs a broken setup.

To uninstall, run `./uninstall.sh` or `uninstall.ps1`. What's left behind:

| | Settings | Voices and ffmpeg |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `~/.config/mimick` | `~/.cache/mimick` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Mimick` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mimick` |

Delete those too for a clean slate.

## Found a bug?

**Open an issue.** Mimick is made by a vibe coder, so yeah, you'll probably
find bugs.

What helps: what you did in order, the PDF if you can share it, any error text
(run `mimick` from a terminal to see it), and which system you're on — distro
plus Wayland or X11, or your Windows version.

**Already known to be rough:**

- **Layout analysis is guesswork.** Some documents will come out wrong. `Ctrl`+`R`
  fixes them by hand — please report any that need a lot of it.
- **Scanned PDFs can't be read** until they've been through OCR.
- **Offline highlighting drifts.** The online voices report the exact moment
  they say each word. Piper doesn't, so the timing is guessed from how long
  each word is — which is close, but a short word can be slow to say and a long
  one quick. Expect the highlight to sit about a fifth of a second off, and up
  to half a second on a tricky sentence. It resets at every full stop, so it
  never wanders far.
- **Footnote markers** arrive stuck to the previous word and get read with it.
- **Windows has never actually been run.** It was developed on Linux and
  reasoned through carefully — the dependencies are checked to have Windows
  wheels, and the PowerShell is checked by PSScriptAnalyzer — but no part of it
  has been run on Windows. The installer, the Start Menu shortcut and the
  ffmpeg download are all unverified, and audio timing in particular may be
  wrong, so the highlight could lag the voice. Reports from the first people to
  try it are genuinely useful.
- **Otherwise only tested on Ubuntu 25.10, GNOME, Wayland.**
