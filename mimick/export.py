"""Convert a document to an MP3 you can listen to away from the computer.

Audio is streamed to a temporary raw file as it is produced rather than held in
memory, so a long book does not grow the process without bound.

The timing constants are measured on this codebase's voice pipeline rather than
guessed -- see ``docs/ROADMAP.md`` for how to re-measure them.
